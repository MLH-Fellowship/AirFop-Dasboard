Note on opening files:

The endpoint that opens the project folder is expecting a file structure like this:


Root Folder
|
| -- FRONTEND (AirFop-Dashboard)
|
| -- BACKEND (AirFop-Backend)
|
| -- PROJECTS
|
| -- FUNDING SOURCE (AF)
|        |
|        | -- PROJECT UUID (TestProject1)
|        |
|        | -- PROJECT UUID (TestProject2)
|
| -- FUNDING SOURCE (Base)
|        |
|        | -- PROJECT UUID (TestProject3)
|        |
|        | -- PROJECT UUID (TestProject4)
|        |
|        | -- PROJECT UUID (TestProject5)
|        
| -- FUNDING SOURCE (EI)
        |
        | -- PROJECT UUID (TestProject6)
        |
        | -- PROJECT UUID (TestProject7)




Where the BACKEND  is in the same root folder as the projects, FUNDING SOURCE is the same as funding_source, the field on the project object & the name of the project folder is the same as the project_name UUID field. For it to work in its current state the fields on the object must match the folder names and not contain spaces or special characters.
