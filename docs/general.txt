Implemented Features: 
    - Filter projects by status and award date
    - Search by project name
    - Save PDF Report
    - Admins can create, edit and delete projects

Not Implemented Features:
    - Login: Admins have greater access than users, however,
        Login is not currently implemented and the use is hard-coded as an admin

    - Reset Password (user not logged in): The UI to request a password rest email for users
        not logged in is designed, but the functionality is not there

    - Security: Once it is setup in the server, passing the user/session token should be added API calls
        in ProjectActions.js and UserActions.js

General Notes:
    - Security: isAdmin and isAuthenticed are currently stored in the state
        They should be incorporated with the access token from the server

    - Email: The navbar and password reset UI assume all users will use an email
        ending in @us.af.mil
