Implemented Features:

    - Search by project name
    - Save PDF Report
    - Admins can create, edit and delete projects

Not Implemented Features:
    - Reset Password (user not logged in): The UI to request a password rest email for users
        not logged in is designed, but the functionality is not there

    - Security: After logging in an access token is stored in a cookie. The token should be required to access the server and then added API calls
        in ProjectActions.js and UserActions.js

General Notes:
    - Email: The password reset UI assumes all users will use an email
        ending in @us.af.mil
